---

## [0.21.4] — 2026-10-06

### Added

- Workspace admins can create a workspace and begin using it under their own
  membership. Accounts with access to multiple workspaces can select the target
  workspace during sign-in, avoiding an ambiguous account-to-workspace choice.

### Fixed

- Team creation now reports a rejected backend response in the settings form
  instead of leaving the user without a clear result.

## [0.21.3] — 2026-10-06

### Added

- Workspace admins can create teams from Workspace settings; the new team and
  its workflow states appear in the workspace navigation after a successful
  response.
- Added an SMTP transport adapter for future email workflows. Invitations do
  not send email through this adapter yet.
- Added GitHub integration, webhook, and feature-parity design proposals. These
  documents describe possible future work; they do not indicate shipped
  integrations.

## [0.21.2] — 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Team cycle settings now show a retry action after a failed read. The Enable
  action stays disabled until settings load successfully, so a network failure
  cannot be mistaken for an unsaved or disabled schedule.
- A retry starts a fresh request and ignores stale responses from an earlier
  settings read.

## [0.21.1] — 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Cycle reconciliation now rejects a clock value older than the saved cycle
  boundary before changing the team's Current pointer or completed-cycle
  history.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-10-01

### Added

- Teams can opt into automatic weekly cycles. An administrator selects the
  weekday; cycle boundaries use the team's timezone, with a Current cycle and
  two Upcoming cycles reconciled transactionally when authenticated cycle data
  is read.
- Added team cycle settings and Current/Upcoming navigation.

### Scope

- Issue auto-assignment and rollover, schedule edits, and disabling an enabled
  cadence are not available in this initial implementation.

## [0.20.2] — 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Team Current and Upcoming cycle routes now apply the selected cycle filter
  before the generic active-issue route, so each page shows issues from the
  requested cycle rather than a broader active list.

## [0.20.1] — 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Project lists now apply the team filter before cursor pagination; cycle
  details are looked up by organization-scoped ID and count only issues in that
  cycle.
- Team Home shortcuts now open that team, local issue-view preferences persist
  per team, and the Workspace More menu closes when the user clicks elsewhere.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-10-01

### Added

- Added team Home, Issues, Cycles, Projects, and Views destinations, with
  Current and Upcoming cycle links backed by team-scoped data.
- Added Workspace More access to Members. Actions without a backend or product
  contract are identified as unavailable instead of appearing functional.

## [0.19.1] — 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Standardized compact typography and spacing across My issues, Inbox, Pulse,
  Initiatives, Projects, and Views; restored the mobile navigation opener on
  Inbox, Pulse, and Initiatives.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-10-01

### Added

- Added browser-local project and workspace issue views with separate scopes,
  local favorites, and team navigation. These saved views are not shared with
  other users or synchronized to the server.
- Added a Create more option to the issue composer for entering several issues
  in sequence.

### Changed

- Project issue lists now group by workflow state and use compact rows; the
  issue composer has a centered layout and clearer save/cancel behavior.

## [0.18.1] — 2026-10-01

### Changed

- Project details now keep properties in a compact overview and open editing
  only on request. The editor uses explicit Save and Discard actions, and
  project updates are composed from the project Activity view.

### Fixed

- Loaded the Inter Variable font locally and aligned project titles, rows, and
  tabs with the rest of the workspace typography.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-10-01

### Added

- Added cursor pagination to workspace projects and project-filtered issues,
  with load-more controls rather than silently stopping at the first page.
- Added project Overview, Activity, and Issues views, project update history,
  and project creation fields supported by the backend.
- Added a status board and supported filter/display controls. Counts and filters
  describe loaded data while additional pages remain.

### Fixed

- Archived projects no longer appear in project detail results; unavailable
  project routes show a missing-project state rather than stale details.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-10-01

### Added

- Added organization-scoped Initiative records, project associations,
  stable cursor listing, and create/update/archive GraphQL operations.
- Replaced Initiatives placeholder with Active/Planned/All views, a scoped
  create form, status filtering, description display, and honest empty states.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-10-01

### Added

- Added recipient-scoped Inbox notifications for future issue creation and
  changes, with stable paging, unread counts, mark-read, archive, and mark-all
  actions; historical events are not reconstructed.
- Replaced the generic Inbox issue dashboard with a responsive notification
  feed, unread-only state, issue navigation, and honest empty/error states.

## [0.15.1] — 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Made project issue rows clickable and keyboard-accessible, opening the
  selected issue with a contextual return to its project.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-10-01

### Added

- Added authenticated project-update publication and a project-scoped Pulse
  composer with required body, health, and duplicate-retry guidance.
- Dogfooded the local project workflow with a started project, nine scoped
  screen-work issues, and a published Pulse update.

### Fixed

- Moved the cramped project editor into page flow, expanded its description
  field, added discard/unchanged-save handling, and separated Archive.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-10-01

### Added

- Added an organization-scoped, paginated project-update post query with a
  persisted revision-9 table, without synthesizing historical posts.
- Replaced the Pulse placeholder with an accessible project-update feed,
  responsive Recent/For me/Popular navigation, loading, empty/error and
  load-more states. Unavailable ranking, subscriptions, comments, reactions
  and custom views are explicitly disclosed rather than simulated.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-10-01

### Added

- Matched the observed Linear sidebar new-issue button silhouette, dimensions,
  light colors, hover, keyboard activation, and close-on-Escape behavior.
- Replaced Hoja’s green brand palette with shared neutral light/dark tokens
  across navigation, My issues, forms, cards, and actions, preserving semantic
  status and error colors.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-09-30

### Added

- Expanded My issues filters to labels, assignee, creator, subscriber, and
  created/updated/due date ranges where the loaded issue fields allow it.
- Added grouping by project, priority, cycle, label, and team plus persistent
  assignee, priority, status, labels, and due-date column controls.

### Fixed

- Labeled filtered counts as loaded results while later pages remain available,
  and returned to sign-in when an expired browser session is rejected.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-09-30

### Added

- Added stable cursor pagination for GraphQL issues and a load-more control in
  My issues, avoiding the previous silent first-100 result limit.
- Added organization-scoped issue activity logging for new mutations and a
  paginated My issues activity feed. Historical changes before migration are
  explicitly unavailable.
- Expanded My issues filters to team, project, cycle presence and content;
  added configurable project/date columns and persistent display preferences.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-09-30

### Added

- Aligned the My issues page shell with the observed Linear title, view tabs,
  compact list groups, and light list surface.
- Added working status/priority filters, focus/status grouping, collapsible
  group counts, and date-grouped recent issue updates with clear disclosure
  that this is not a complete activity history.

### Fixed

- Kept Assigned issues scoped to the viewer and excluded completed/canceled
  issues from its active list; empty and filtered counts reflect visible data.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-09-30

### Added

- Matched the Hoja navigation rail's width, compact rows, workspace header,
  section order, and light selection treatment to the observed Linear sidebar.
- Added sidebar-first Pulse, Initiatives, and favorite Views placeholders that
  explicitly state they are not yet available, without replacing working Hoja
  destinations.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-09-22

### Added

- Added an initial first-party self-hosted workspace UI served by the local
  backend, with token login, workspace/team navigation, issue listing, search,
  and state filtering.
- Added Docker Compose packaging for the application and PostgreSQL with
  persistent storage and health checks.

### Changed

- Documented Cliniar as a standalone self-hosted product rather than only a
  CLI client for Linear Cloud.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-26

### Changed

- Renamed the product and canonical distribution to **Cliniar**, a generic
  self-hosted, offline-first, agent-native work-management system with a
  Linear-compatible GraphQL interface.
- Canonical executables are now `cliniar`, `cliniar-mcp`, and `cliniar-serve`;
  Python packages, release artifacts, skill metadata, documentation, and
  configuration/data directories use `cliniar`.
- Canonical application variables now use the `CLINIAR_*` prefix. The existing
  `LINEAR_TOKEN` and `LINEAR_API_URL` variables remain unchanged, as do Linear
  API field names and GraphQL wire names.
- Removed product ownership and deployment assumptions from the self-hosted
  backend. CloverOps is one tested external consumer of the compatible GraphQL
  surface, not a product owner or required deployment.

### Deprecated

- `clinear`, `clinear-mcp`, and `clinear-serve` remain as executable aliases for
  one release. They are compatibility shims; scripts and new integrations must
  move to the canonical commands now.
- Matching `CLINEAR_*` variables are read only as one-release fallbacks when
  their `CLINIAR_*` equivalents are unset.
- Existing `~/.config/clinear/` and `$XDG_DATA_HOME/clinear/` files are detected
  only when the canonical `cliniar/` location is absent. Copy configuration and
  data into the canonical location; do not maintain two writable copies.
- The skill installer can create deprecated `clinear` discovery symlinks only
  when explicitly passed `--legacy-links`, and never removes or replaces an
  arbitrary existing directory.

### Migration

1. Replace command names with `cliniar`, `cliniar-mcp`, and `cliniar-serve`.
2. Rename application variables from `CLINEAR_*` to `CLINIAR_*`; leave
   `LINEAR_TOKEN` and `LINEAR_API_URL` unchanged.
3. Move configuration to `~/.config/cliniar/config.toml` (or
   `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cliniar/config.toml`) and local data to
   `$XDG_DATA_HOME/cliniar/` (normally `~/.local/share/cliniar/`).
4. Reinstall the canonical `skills/cliniar` skill. Use `--legacy-links` only
   for agents that cannot yet discover the new name.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-15

### Added
- **`clinear-serve` — a local, self-hosted, Linear-API-compatible backend**
  (new optional `clinear_server` package; install with `pip install 'clinear[server]'`).
  Speaks the GraphQL subset used by clinear and compatible consumers, so
  the CLI runs fully **offline** against a single-file SQLite database with **no
  rate limits**.
  - `clinear-serve seed` provisions a tenant (org, admin user, team, seeded
    workflow states, API token) and prints the token.
  - `clinear-serve serve` runs the GraphQL server on `127.0.0.1` (FastAPI/Starlette
    + Ariadne + SQLAlchemy Core). `--open` enables zero-friction offline mode
    (any token maps to the seeded identity).
  - `clinear-serve token` mints additional tokens for a tenant.
  - **Multi-tenant by token:** each API token maps to exactly one organization;
    every resolver is org-scoped, so tenants are isolated by construction. One
    backend endpoint serves N tenants via N tokens.
  - Implements `rateLimitStatus` returning effectively-unlimited values and never
    emits HTTP 429.
  - Per-team monotonic issue identifier counter (`ENG-1`, `ENG-2`, …), derived
    `priorityLabel`/`url`/`branchName`, and workflow state-transition timestamps.
  - **PostgreSQL shared-database support:** all server commands resolve explicit
    `--database-url` then `CLINEAR_DATABASE_URL` then the existing SQLite target;
    psycopg 3 uses connection pre-ping and SQLite-only pragmas remain isolated.
    Organization URL keys are unique, token minting explicitly selects an
    organization and user/email in shared databases, API token hashes are
    globally unique, and issue counters use a portable organization-scoped
    atomic update in the insert transaction.
  - Ordered schema revisions support upgrades of existing SQLite and PostgreSQL
    deployments; `clinear-serve migrate` is the explicit hosted deployment step.
  - Mutation references are validated against the authenticated organization
    and compatible team before writes, including states, assignees, projects,
    cycles, parents, labels, project leads, and project-team relationships.
  - CloverOps compatibility includes batched bootstrap aliases, top-level
    workflow-state/cycle filters, project teams/health, issue identifier lookup,
    state transitions, comments, and persisted URL attachments.
  - `$CLINEAR_APP_URL` configures generated issue/project links for owned hosted
    deployments (local default `http://localhost:8787`), and `/ready` verifies
    database connectivity plus schema currency separately from `/health`.
- **`base_url` account setting** (`accounts.<name>.base_url`) plus the
  `$LINEAR_API_URL` environment override, letting clinear point at a local
  backend (or any Linear-compatible endpoint) with no other change. Defaults to
  the real Linear API when unset.
- `scripts/e2e-local-backend.sh` — a 17-check end-to-end suite that boots the
  local backend and drives the real clinear CLI against it (me, teams, states,
  issue create/get/state/assign/prio, comments, filters, search, labels, auth).

### Notes
- Sync (offline↔online op-log + LWW) remains a separate, unimplemented feature.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-24
### Added
- **Intelligent account auto-selection by team key.** Accounts can now declare
  the team keys they own via `teams = ["SWA", "ENG"]` (config), the new
  `clinear auth add --teams "SWA,ENG"` flag, or `clinear auth teams <name> "SWA,ENG"`.
  When a command targets a team — through `--team SWA` or an identifier like
  `SWA-20` — clinear picks the owning account (and its token) automatically,
  with no `--account` flag or env-var juggling. Resolution order is now:
  `--account` › team-key ownership › workspace mapping › default › first.
- `clinear auth teams <name> "<keys>"` command to set/clear an account's team keys.
- `teams` shown in `clinear auth accounts` output (human + JSON).

### Fixed
- **WorkflowState enum no longer crashes on undocumented state types.** Teams
  with a workflow state whose `type` is outside the six documented categories
  (e.g. `"duplicate"`) previously broke `clinear team states` and
  `clinear issue state` with a Pydantic validation error. The `type` field is
  now a smart union (`WorkflowStateType | str`): known types become the enum,
  unknown types pass through as plain strings.

### Changed
- Agent skill (`SKILL.md` + `skill_content/`) rewritten to match reality:
  corrected the multi-account/auth section (removed the dangerous "rewrite to
  `[auth]`" advice), fixed `comment add`/`comment edit` to positional body
  (no `--body` flag), documented `--account` and the new team auto-selection.

### Tests
- New offline unit suite `tests/test_account_resolution.py` (20 tests) covering
  `team_key_from_hint`, `resolve_account` precedence, `resolve_token`, and the
  WorkflowState smart-union.

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Project memory board** (`clinear memory`) — persistent project-scoped memory
  for agents. Every agent invocation should start with `clinear memory remind`
  to load forced behavioral rules and recent community learnings.
  - `memory remind` — print a formatted digest (forced rules + community context)
  - `memory list` — list all entries with metadata
  - `memory add --title "..." --body "..."` — add a community entry
  - `memory update <id>` — edit an existing entry
  - `memory remove <id>` — delete an entry
  - `memory heal --dry-run` — remove stale community entries (older than
    `heal_after_days`, default 30)
  - Storage: `.clinear/memory.yaml` in the git repo root (project-scoped)
  - Seeded with 5 forced rules: verify auth, search before create, use JSON
    for piping, dry-run on ambiguous mutations, read memory board first
  - Community entries auto-heal after 30 days; forced entries never expire
- Cron-ready: `clinear memory heal` can be scheduled daily to keep the board
  clean and relevant.

### Files Changed
- `clinear/memory_board.py` — storage layer (YAML read/write, heal logic)
- `clinear/commands/memory.py` — 6 subcommands
- `clinear/cli.py` — register `memory_app`
- `clinear/skill_content/overview.md` — add memory board rules

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Multi-account credential support** — manage multiple Linear accounts and switch
  between them automatically per workspace or via explicit `--account` flag.
  - New config schema: `[accounts.<name>]` sections with `token`, `token_env`,
    and auto-populated `org_name`.
  - Workspace-aware defaults: git repository roots can be mapped to specific
    accounts via `config.toml [workspaces]` or automatically detected.
  - New `clinear auth` subcommands:
    - `auth accounts` — list all accounts with default/workspace/current markers
    - `auth add <name> --token <token>` — add a named account (optionally
      verifies token against Linear API to populate `org_name`)
    - `auth switch <name>` — set global default account
    - `auth remove <name>` — remove an account
    - `auth workspace` — show current git repo workspace and mapped account
  - New global flag: `--account <name>` / `-a <name>` — one-off override for
    any subcommand.
  - Backward compatibility: existing `[auth]` sections auto-migrate to
    `accounts.default` on first load. Single-account behavior is preserved
    as fallback.
- **`clinear update`** — self-update command that checks PyPI for the latest
  version and runs the appropriate upgrade command (`pip install --upgrade` or
  `pipx upgrade`). Supports `--dry-run` and `--yes` flags. JSON output mode
  supported for agent consumption.
- New dependency: `tomli-w>=1.0` (required for writing config updates from
  `auth add/switch/remove` commands).

### Changed

- `config.py` — replaced single `AuthConfig` with `AccountConfig` and
  `AccountsConfig` dict. Added `resolve_account()` for workspace-aware
  account selection and `save_config()` for persisting config changes.
- `cli_state.py` — added `account_name` field to `CLIState` for tracking
  the active account.
- `cli.py` — added `--account` global flag and `update` command registration.
- `init.py` — updated config template to use multi-account schema.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- `issue create --project` and `issue update --project` now accept project **slugId**
  (e.g. `24a5eb4e800e`) and project **name** in addition to the full UUID. Previously,
  passing a slugId (the short identifier shown in the Linear UI) caused an
  "Argument Validation Error" from the Linear API because the mutation's
  `projectId` field requires the full 36-char UUID. A new `_resolve_project_id`
  helper now resolves slugIds and names to canonical UUIDs before sending the
  mutation, matching the resolution pattern already used for teams, labels, and
  states.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-14

### Added

- **Agent skill bundle** at `skills/clinear/` — a Swarm/Claude-style skill
  (SKILL.md frontmatter + `references/*.md`) that teaches AI agents both the
  mechanics of the CLI and the *behavior* of working through Linear (when to
  search before create, when to use `--output json`, how to chain commands,
  safety rules, anti-patterns). Install with `bash skills/install.sh`.
- **`clinear-mcp` MCP server** — optional Model Context Protocol server
  exposing:
  - **1 tool** `clinear_guide(topic)` returning structured teaching content
    (`overview` / `commands` / `workflows` / `filters` / `output-formats`
    / `examples`).
  - **7 read-only resources**: `clinear://me`, `clinear://issue/{id}`,
    `clinear://team/{key}`, `clinear://project/{id_or_slug}`,
    `clinear://cycle/current/{team_key}`, `clinear://issues/mine`,
    `clinear://issues/team/{team_key}`.
  - **6 prompt templates**: `triage`, `daily_standup`, `create_from_error`,
    `hand_off`, `cycle_review`, `issue_investigate`.
- **By design no mutation tools** on the MCP server. Mutations happen via
  the `clinear` CLI in a shell — every tool/prompt response carries a
  reminder reinforcing this rule.
- `clinear/skill_content/` — canonical markdown source bundled inside the
  wheel via `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]`. Single source
  of truth for both the skill bundle and the MCP server.
- New optional dependency extra: `pip install 'clinear[mcp]'` pulls in
  `mcp>=1.12.0`. Core install stays untouched for users who don't need MCP.
- New console script `clinear-mcp` (entry point of the MCP server).

### Changed

- Bumped version to 0.3.0.
- Updated User-Agent string emitted by `LinearClient` to `clinear/0.3.0`.

### Notes

- The MCP code is **lazy-imported**. Users who install `clinear` without the
  `[mcp]` extra are not affected; the `clinear-mcp` script prints a friendly
  install hint and exits 2 if invoked without the dep.
- ALL MCP server logging is routed to stderr to keep stdio JSON-RPC clean.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-14

### Added
- `clinear init` — scaffold the config file at `~/.config/clinear/config.toml`.
- `clinear comment` group: `list`, `add`, `edit`, `delete`.
- `clinear label` group: `list`, `create`, `delete`.
- Label resolution in `issue create` and `issue update` — accept label names
  (comma-separated) and resolve to UUIDs server-side per team.
- `VERSION` file at the repo root; `__version__` now reads from it.
- `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed
- `cycle current` now exits 0 with `{ "active_cycle": null }` (JSON) or
  a friendly message (human) instead of crashing with NotFoundError when
  a team has no active cycle.
- `issue search` results now render a full table with priority, state,
  assignee, and identifier columns.
- Bumped version to 0.2.0.

### Fixed
- 4 issues from the v0.1 smoke test:
  - `Issue.labels` / `Issue.subscribers` now flatten the GraphQL
    `{nodes: [...]}` connection wrapper automatically.
  - `searchIssues` no longer spreads the `Issue` fragment on
    `IssueSearchResult` (different GraphQL type).
  - YAML formatter no longer collapses nested object indentation.
  - Error exit codes propagate correctly through the typer entrypoint.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-14

Initial release.

### Added
- Core commands: `me`, `auth status/whoami`, `team list/get/states/members`,
  `issue list/get/create/update/state/assign/prio/url/search`,
  `project list/get`, `cycle current/list`, `raw query`.
- Pydantic v2 models for User, Team, Issue, Project, Cycle, WorkflowState.
- Async httpx GraphQL client with auth, retry, error handling, rate-limit
  awareness, and pagination helper.
- Six output formats: `human` (Rich tables), `json`, `yaml`, `md` (markdown),
  `plain` (TSV), `ids` (one identifier per line).
- Filter DSL for `issue list` covering team/state/assignee/project/cycle/
  label/priority/free-text/date filters.
- Token resolution from `--token` flag, `LINEAR_TOKEN` env var, or
  `config.toml`.
- Typed exit codes (0–8) for scriptable error handling.
- `--dry-run` for safe mutation previews.
- 28/29 passing E2E tests against the live Linear API.
