"""MCP prompt templates.

Each prompt returns a multi-line markdown string. The MCP client renders this
as a user message that walks the agent through running `clinear` commands in
a specific order. Every prompt:

  1. Lists the exact shell commands to execute (in order).
  2. Says what to look for in each response.
  3. Includes the standard behavioral reminder at the end.

The prompts NEVER perform mutations themselves. They tell the agent which
`clinear` commands to call via the Bash tool.

You are about to triage the unassigned backlog for team **{team_key}**.

## Step 1 — Scope the queue

Run:

```bash
clinear issue list --team {team_key} --no-assignee --state Todo -n 20
```

Read the list. Identify the top 3–5 issues that look highest-priority based on
title + label.

## Step 2 — Inspect each candidate

For each candidate ID:

```bash
clinear issue get <ID>
```

Skim the description and recent comments. Decide:

- Does it have enough context? If not, comment asking the reporter.
- Is the priority field obviously wrong? Note the correction.
- Is the right label set?

## Step 3 — Act

For each issue you've decided to take action on:

```bash
clinear issue assign <ID> <USER_NAME>   # or 'me'
clinear issue update <ID> --priority <N> --label "<labels>"
clinear issue state <ID> "<NEXT_STATE>"   # e.g. "In Progress"
```

## Step 4 — Document

If the triage decision needs a paper trail (e.g. reassigning across teams),
post a comment:

```bash
clinear comment add <ID> --body "Triaged: assigned to <name>, priority <N> because <reason>"
```

```bash

```

## Step 2 — What I'm working on today

```bash
clinear -o md issue list --assignee me --state "In Progress" -n 20
clinear -o md issue list --assignee me --state "In Review" -n 20

## Step 3 — Blockers

```bash
clinear -o md issue list --assignee me --label blocked -n 10

Combine the three sections above into:

```
## Yesterday
- <CLO-XX>: title
- ...

## Today
- <CLO-YY>: title
- ...

## Blockers
- <CLO-ZZ>: title — reason

The user has provided an error trace and asked you to file an issue.

```bash

If a matching issue exists, do not create a new one — comment on the existing
issue instead:

```bash
clinear comment add <EXISTING_ID> --body "<<<DELIM

The create response includes the new issue's identifier (e.g. `{team_key}-NN`).
Surface it to the user along with `clinear issue url <ID>` for a clickable link.

## Step 2 — Move to a review/blocked state

(Substitute the right state name. Use `clinear team states <TEAM_KEY>` if you
need to confirm available states for this team.)

## Step 3 — Document the hand-off

```bash
clinear comment add {issue_id} --body "Handing off to {to_user} — {note_line}"

**Behavioral rule:** never reassign without a comment explaining why and what
the receiver needs to know. A bare reassignment creates ambiguity downstream.

```bash
clinear cycle current {team_key}

If the response indicates no active cycle, stop and tell the user — there is
nothing to review.

## Step 2 — Inventory the cycle by state

```bash
clinear -o json issue list --cycle current --team {team_key} \\

Combine the above into a structured summary:

Based on state + labels + comments, suggest one of:
- comment with a clarifying question
- assign (with `clinear issue assign`)
- move state (with `clinear issue state`)
- close as duplicate (set state to `Canceled` and link via comment)
- prioritize (with `clinear issue prio`)

Do **not** mutate the issue yet — propose the action and wait for the user's
go-ahead.
